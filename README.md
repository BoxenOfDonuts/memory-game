# memory-game
Memory game created using functional components. Click a card and the order shuffles, if you click on a previously clicked card, you lose!
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Thoughts... :thinking:
This one came a lot easier than the CV project, probably mostly because of the hours of pain actually making the CV and learning state and props in react. This project fetches information from [the Yu-Gi-Oh! Card Database](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/), then presents 16 random cards to play the game with.
